# Generation of a cooling table
Cooling processes in the accretion disk of black holes, generation of cooling table to be used in the code H-AMR.

This cooling was based in the paper of ESIN 1996ApJ...465..312E . Main processes considered are: Bremmstrahlung radiative losses, Synchrotron radiative losses and Inverse compton enhancement of synchrotron radiative losses.

# STEPS:
Compile and run Tabela.c file to generate a list to RADIUS, TEMPERATURE AND ELECTRONIC DENSITY.

Compile and run solvetrans.c file to generate the cooling table.

Enjoy
