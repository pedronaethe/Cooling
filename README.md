# Cooling
Cooling processes in the accretion disk of black holes, generation of cooling table to be used in the code H-AMR

## This cooling was based in the paper of ESIN 1996ApJ...465..312E ##

# STEPS:
Compile and run Tabela.c file to generate a list to RADIUS, TEMPERATURE AND ELECTRONIC DENSITY.
Compile and run solvetrans.c file to generate the cooling table.

## Enjoy
